 <h3 align="justify"> <i> Hey everyone, this is probably the project that I have dedicated myself the most so far. It's a guessing game, you can do operations to find a number from 1-100. </i> </h3>
<h3 align="justify"> <i> I'm posting this project after having implemented all the changes that I always propose after posting a project here. So it already has a rules popup, responsive for any desktop, two languages (English and Portuguese), buttons for my socials and all sorts of silly details.<br><br> </i> </h3>

  <h3 align="justify"><i>Its rules are: You can check if the number is divisible, greater than or less than something, twice each. If you can find the number after that, you've won. You can play in my <a href="https://italicnich.github.io/guess_game/">Github-Pages Link</a></i></h3>

<h3 align="justify"><i>Another relevant point was the "no-google/youtube" challenge, So on the technical side, this was perhaps the most challenging project.</i></h3>

<h3 align="justify"><i>Perhaps the most interesting function is the language switch, where I use an increment (+1) along with a check if it's odd or even (%2) to switch between languages.</i></h3>
