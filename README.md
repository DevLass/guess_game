 <h3 align="justify"> <i> Hey everyone, this is probably the project that I have dedicated myself the most so far. It's a guessing game, you can do operations to find a number from 1-100. </i> </h3>
<h3 align="justify"> <i> I'm posting this project after having implemented all the changes that I always propose after posting a project here. So it already has a rules popup, two languages (English and Portuguese), buttons for my socials and all sorts of silly details.<br><br>
<p align="center">

Its rules are: You can check if the number is divisible, greater than or less than something, twice each. If you can find the number after that, you've won.</i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"><i>I would like to implement a bookmark button and maybe a like button in the future, but honestly I have no idea how to do that. So this update should take a little longer.</i></h3>

Thanks for reading, see you soon
